FINAL YEAR PROJECT : - "GDP Growth Prediction of India Using ML Algorithm".

Our project, "GDP Growth Prediction of India Using Machine Learning Algorithm," focuses on developing a predictive model for India's GDP growth using the linear regression model. By integrating diverse data sources, including socioeconomic indicators, industry trends, and global economic factors, we enhance the prediction accuracy.

We employed linear regression for modeling, along with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and validation to ensure the modelâ€™s reliability. Additionally, time-series analysis and sentiment analysis techniques were applied to capture the dynamic nature of economic indicators.

This model aims to support informed decision-making by policymakers, investors, and businesses, helping them in policy formulation, asset allocation, and market strategy.

The research paper, published on the IJIRCCE platform, highlights the potential of machine learning in economic forecasting and provides actionable insights for shaping India's economic future.
